# Practical Exercises for Software Programming (CS2020)

This is where practicals will be posted from the CS2020 course in Software Programming.

A few key things to remember when updating repository is:

* Use `git add .` for staging new files and folders to the repository.
* Use `git commit -m ""` for committing the changes to the repository.
* Use `git push` to update the repository on GitHub with the new files/folders.

* Use `mkdir dirName` to create a new folder from the terminal.
* Use `echo > fileName.fileType` to create a new file in the current folder.

You can check the status of the repository using `git status`.

When entering a folder, you type `cd folderName` into the terminal, and `cd ..` to exit the folder.

## Week 1

Contained in the `Practical_1` folder is the code for Week 1. It was only a starter folder used to enable version source control. The repository is now on GitHub, and is accessed via remote SSH access.

There are some very basic Java programs in there from RuneStone academy.

Learned that there is a comment type called the doc-comment denoted by a `/**` and a `*/`. These comments are pulled out by the javadoc tool which will then make documentation of a class as a web page.
