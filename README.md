A few key things to remember when updating repository is:

* Use `git add .` for staging new files and folders to the repository.
* Use `git commit -m ""` for committing the changes to the repository.
* Use `git push` to update the repository on GitHub with the new files/folders.

You can check the status of the repository using `git status`.

When entering a folder, you type `cd folderName` into the terminal, and `cd ..` to exit the folder.
